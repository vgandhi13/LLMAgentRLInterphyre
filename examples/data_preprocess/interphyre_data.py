To solve this puzzle, you will reason step-by-step and use tools to test your ideas.

At each step, you MUST follow this exact format:

Thought: <your reasoning about what to do next>
Action: <tool name>
Action Input: <JSON arguments, or {} for tools with no arguments>
Observation: <result from the tool>

Then you continue with another Thought/Action cycle.

When you are confident in your answer, use the "finish" tool to submit it.

CRITICAL: After every Action Input line, you MUST write "Observation:" on the next line and wait for the result. Never skip the Observation line.

Important rules:
- Always start with a Thought before taking an Action.
- Only call ONE tool per step.
- Parse observation results carefully before your next thought.
- You can simulate multiple different actions to compare results.
- Each simulation resets the environment, so previous simulations do not affect new ones.
- When a simulation fails repeatedly, investigate WHY before trying again.
